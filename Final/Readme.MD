This is an addon that contains two texture related functions.

The first function is to bake textures from blender in pbr format (for proceduraly mad materials in Blender).

The second function is to convert a pbr texture set to Unreal texture set by combining the AO, Roughness, and Mettalic maps into a singular map in the cycles shader editor and bake it back out.
