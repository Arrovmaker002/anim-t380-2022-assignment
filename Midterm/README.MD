The Python folder contains a script that will duplicate frames froma  directory to a directory of your choice.
Run from a python interpreter, or from application python/script editors.

The script uses this naming convention:
```````````````````````````````````````
'project name'_'scene name'_'shot'_'version'_frame number

Tips when using this script: 
--- Image format is taken from the original files automatically. 

--- Frame padding option includes the frame number (e.g: frame padding of 5 at frame 150 will end up as frame#_00150, not as frame#_00000150)

--- The script will copy files to the new direcctory before renaming them. Watch your typing as you will have to restart the operation if there is an error.
