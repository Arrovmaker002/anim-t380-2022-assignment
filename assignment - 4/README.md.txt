This directory contains two scripts to save a new version of the scene with numbered naming convention;

- Script 1 attempts to create a copy of the current scene with a version number in the scenes directory when run. Keeping track of at which version it is at through a cache (sort of) file.

- Script 2 uses the built-in increment-and-save function of Maya and uses the Mel command when run.
